      <h2> Early Life </h2>

      <p>Jack St. Clair Kilby was born on November 8, 1923, in Jefferson City,
        Missouri. When he was young, his family moved to Great Bend Kansas. His
        father, Hubert Kilby, was an electrical engineer and president of the
        Kansas Power Company of Great Bend. After an ice storm downed all the
        power and telephone lines, Kilby accompanied his father as he worked
        with amateur radio (also known as ham radio) operators to talk to
        customers and run the company. After experiencing this experience, the
        then teenage Jack Kilby became obsessed with amateur radio. He was also
        a fan of broadcast radio. </p>
      <h2> Education </h2>

        </p>
        <p> After high school, Kilby applied to MIT, but barely missed passing
          the math section of his exam. He then enrolled at his father’s
          university, the University of Illinois, and studied to become an
          electrical engineer. However, his education was interrupted by World
          War II. He joined the United States Army and served as a radio
          operator and repairman at the India-China-Burma Theatre. After his
          time in the army, he returned to the electrical engineering program at
          the University of Illinois. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in
          electrical engineering in 1947. </p>
        <h2> Career </h2>

          <p><img src="career.png" <="" div="" style="width: 221px; height: 221px;">
          </p>
          <p> After graduating he met his wife, Barbara Annegers Kilby and moved
            to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to join the Centralab Division of Globe
            Union, Incorporated. He oversaw designing and developing
            miniaturized electronic circuits. During this time Kilby also took
            night classes at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Extension
            Division. He was sent by Centralab to Bell Industries to learn about
            their newest invention, the transistor. When Kilby returned to
            Centralab, he began working on germanium-based transistors. He soon
            realized that he would need the resources of a larger company to
            miniaturize circuits, and in 1958 he transferred to Texas
            Instruments Inc., located in Dallas, Texas. During his time at Texas
            Instruments, Kilby made major breakthroughs with miniaturized
            circuits. He realized that he could make the entire assembly as one
            unit instead of connecting different pieces together. He did it by
            using a material with semi-conductive properties and overlaying it
            with other impurities to replicate electronic components, like
            resistors, capacitors, and transistors. Not long after, he had a
            working prototype made from germanium that was the size of a postage
            stamp. In February 1959, Texas Instruments filed a patent
            application for the miniaturized electronic circuit (the world’s
            first integrated circuit). The circuit was Kilby’s most important
            patent, however, he had over 50 patents. Many of his patents were
            improvements and modifications for his integrated circuit. One of
            which was for an integrated circuit powered computer Texas
            Instruments designed for the U.S. Airforce. Another was for an
            integrated circuit designed for use in the U.S. Airforce’s Minuteman
            ballistic missile guidance system. In 1967 he designed the first
            integrated circuit calculator, called the Pocketronic. At first the
            calculator required too many circuits to be manufactured for
            consumers, but by the early 1970s it required less and was sold as
            the TI Datamath pocket calculator. Over time, integrated circuits
            have made their way into many areas of everyday life. They are found
            in every electronic device that has a microprocessor, from phones,
            to music players, to computers. In 1970, Jack Kilby took a leave of
            absence from Texas Instruments to focus on his own independent work.
            He mainly focused on how to apply silicon technology to help
            generate electrical power from sunlight. From 1978 to 1984, Kilby
            was a Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at Texas
            A&amp;M University. He fully retired from Texas Instruments in the
            1980s, however he still was involved with the company.</p>
