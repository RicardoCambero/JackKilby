      <h2> Honors and Awards </h2>
      <p> Kilby was presented with many honors and awards. He was awarded the
        National Medal of Science in 1969, the Charles Stark Draper Medal in
        1989, and the National Medal of Technology in 1990. In 1997, Texas
        Instruments named their new research and development center the Kilby
        Center after him. The Royal Swedish Academy of Science, which previously
        recognized only theoretical physicists, awarded half of the 2000 Nobel
        Prize for Physics to Kilby for his work as an applied physicist. </p>
